# notes on programming openfoam

## puledFixedBoundary condition excercise

- the `updateCoeffs()` function is where all the magic happens. `updateCoeffs()` because the function updates the coefficients of the matrix - the discretized equation!
- every time a term is added to the equations, the `updateCoeffs()` function will be called. To avoid unecessary computations, an `if` clause at the beginning of the function checks if the function has been called before (in the current solution time step).
- the calculation and effectively the assigning of the newly calculated values is implemented in the assign operator `==`. This operator actually also works on boundary faces, whereas `=` would ignore boundary cells with a fixedValue boundary condition.
- the bool switch to check whether the coefficients have already been updated is defined in the base class `fvPatchFields`. 
- In the case of the `pulsedFixedValue` boundary condition, there three levels of abstraction: `fvPatchField -> fixedValue -> pulseFixedValue`
- `$FOAM_TUTORIALS/resources` includes a lot of useful templates!
- the `value uniform (10 0 0);` entry is only needed for paraview. OpenFOAM caculates the values itself. 
- when implementing boundary conditions everything that is read in at the beginning of the simulation needs to be written out again to enable restarting the simulation.
- this is a great way to debug your simulation: `grep -A 8 inlet 0.01/U` will e.g. print your the boundary condition dict into `0.01/U`.

## Function1 boundary conditions

- Function1 is a virtual function that helps to implement varying times. Can be specified at run time.

## building a solver

- `icoFoam` is still available in openfoam as an example. In the next example we are going to add porous media to icoFoam.
- `volVectorField` and `volScalarField` are both typedefs/derived from `GeometricField`
  - There are two components to a `GeometricField`: `GeometricField::Boundary` and `GeometricField::Internal`
  - `Boundary` is a `fvPatchField`
  - `Internal` is a typedef of a `DimensionedField`
- `createPhi.H` what is `phi` -> face flux field: volumentric flux through the faces of any given cell.
- finding an implementation example `find $FOAM_SRC -name "*.[CH]" -type f | xargs -i grep cellZone[0] {}`
- `#include fvCFD.H` bundles most of the important imports needed for building any finite volume application
- fluxes are needed for mass conservation as the fluxes in an incompressible case add up to $0$.

## post processing - writing a function object

- calculate the kinetic energy for the complete domain: $K = \frac{1}{2} \rho |U^2|$
- there are some pre-defined methods, such as `execute`, `write`, `read` and `end`
- the `execute` method is called during each time step
- the `write` method is only called when you're scheduled to write out.
- the `end` method is only called when everything is finalized.
- 99/100 cases the `write` function is used (controlled by the output parameter). an exception is temporal averaging, where the calculations need to be executed every time step.
- protected class members are private to the class and all derived classes
- `Foam::fvc` namespace includes all sorts of nice calculation algorithms, including domainIntegration: `FOAM_SRC/finiteVolume/finiteVolume/fvc/fvc.H`
- OFstream provides a framework for writing out data
